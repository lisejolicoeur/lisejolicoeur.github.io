excerpt: 'HPC workflows increasingly integrate diverse technologies such asartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data analytics,databases, and web services. Orchestrators like Kubernetes have beendesigned to facilitate deploying these heterogeneous workloads in cloudenvironments. Allowing Kubernetes to be launched and managed as a resourceon HPC clusters would facilitate the deployment of modern workflows in HPCenvironments. To enable the deployment of Kubernetes by unprivileged HPCusers, we evaluate the usability of a rootless version of Kubernetes,Usernetes. We analyze synthetic benchmarks as well as HPC and ML proxy appsto evaluate the overhead of Usernetes for HPC/ML workloads deployed on highperformance networks and GPUs. While the results show that applicationsrunning in Usernetes can take advantage of InfiniBand networks and NVIDAGPUs, some benchmarks incur measurable overheads at scale which warrantfurther investigation.'
