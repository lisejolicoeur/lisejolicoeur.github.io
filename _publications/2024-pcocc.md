permalink: /publication/2024-pcocc
excerpt: 'To address the increasing complexity of modern scientific computing workflows, HPC clusters must be able to accommodate a wider range of workloads without compromising their efficiency in processing batches of highly parallel jobs. Cloud computing providers have a long history of leveraging all forms of virtualization to let their clients easily and securely deploy complex distributed applications and similar capabilities are now expected from HPC facilities.'
